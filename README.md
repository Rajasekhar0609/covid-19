# ü¶† COVID-19 Data Exploration (SQL Project)

This project explores global COVID-19 trends using SQL. It analyzes infections, death rates, recovery rates, and performs comparisons between countries and WHO regions using a static dataset (`country_wise_latest.csv`).

## üìÅ Dataset Used

- **File**: `country_wise_latest.csv`
- **Source**: Kaggle or similar COVID-19 open dataset
- **Columns Include**:
  - `Country/Region`
  - `Confirmed`, `Deaths`, `Recovered`, `Active`
  - `New cases`, `New deaths`, `New recovered`
  - `Deaths / 100 Cases`, `Recovered / 100 Cases`
  - `1 week change`, `1 week % increase`
  - `WHO Region`

---

## üß† Objectives

- Analyze total and new COVID-19 cases
- Compare death and recovery rates per country
- Examine weekly growth trends
- Group and summarize data by WHO region
- Conceptualize rolling average (for time-series data)
